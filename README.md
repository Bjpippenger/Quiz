Created a code quiz .
Added a start button which starts the questions and timer.
If question is answered incorrectly then 10 seconds is taken off of the clock.
When all the questions are answered or the timer runs out the game is over.
Lastly I added a save my initials and score funtion as well as something that shows previous high scores.
